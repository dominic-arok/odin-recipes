        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Carne Asada Fries are baked Mexican spiced French fries smothered in cheese and piled high with tender juicy marinated steak, salsa, avocado crema and whatever else your heart desires.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lime juice</li>
            <li>1 pound beef flank steak, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen French fries</li>
            <li>2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon guacamole seasoning mix</li>
            <li>1/2 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sour cream, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, salt, pepper, garlic powder, cumin, chili powder, Cajun seasoning, and lime juice in a glass or ceramic bowl; add steak. Cover and let marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour, up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill until firm and cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Deep-fry the French fries in the hot oil until golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes, working in batches and adding more oil as needed. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>Mash avocados with guacamole seasoning in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Place the fries on a microwave-safe plate and layer with cooked carne asada and Mexican cheese. Heat in the microwave for 20 seconds. Add guacamole, sour cream, and finish it with green onions.</li>
        </ol>
