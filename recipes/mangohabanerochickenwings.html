        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>30 chicken wing sections</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can mango nectar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>6 habanero peppers, stemmed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rice vinegar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
            <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse chicken wings and pat dry with paper towels. Place onto a baking sheet, cover, and refrigerate until sauce is finished.</li>
            <li>Purée mango nectar, brown sugar, habanero peppers, soy sauce, Sriracha, and vinegar in a food processor (habanero seeds will still be visible). Remove the food processor lid carefully as the pepper fumes can be strong.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Immediately add mango-habanero mixture and bring to a simmer, stirring frequently. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir in honey. Simmer, stirring frequently, until sauce is reduced by 75% and thickened to a glaze, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is cooking, place a rimmed baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place cornstarch in a resealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Remove wings from the refrigerator and toss in small batches in cornstarch to lightly coat. Place in a single layer onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Fry 5 to 6 wings at a time in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, about 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels, then place on the baking sheet in the preheated oven to keep warm while you fry remaining batches.</li>
            <li>Remove wings from the oven and place into a large bowl. Pour 1/2 of the hot sauce over top and mix to coat. Continue adding sauce until wings are coated to your liking.</li>
        </ol>
